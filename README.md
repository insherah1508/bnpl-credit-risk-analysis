# BNPL Credit Risk Analysis

## Business Problem
Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) providers must balance customer growth with credit risk.
Approving too many users increases defaults, while being too strict limits revenue.

This project simulates a BNPL underwriting strategy using public lending data to:
- Analyze default risk
- Optimize approval decisions
- Evaluate purchasing power trade-offs

## Dataset
Public consumer lending dataset (Lending Club-style data).

## Key Questions
- Who should be approved or declined?
- How does default risk vary by credit score and income?
- How does purchasing power impact risk?

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Status
Completed
